# CAHGenIRL
Cards Against Humanity generator with(and mainly) Hebrew support, made for fun mostly and some memes with r/ani_bm.

Make one .txt file with all the entries you want one entry per line,
do the same but with the credits file for each entry(the number of lines in both files most match, as for every entry there is credit) per line.

follow the instructions and pdf file will be saved at C:\Users\Public\Documents .

The logo is at the moment permenant, aka it's the r/ani_bm logo with the title "קלפים נגד הממשלה"
